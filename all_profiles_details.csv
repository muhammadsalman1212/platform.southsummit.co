After an intense experience at Geneva I began work in a tech startup in Spain at the very beginning of iAhorro.com with a lean team of three people. After a couple of months’ work, the project enthused me. A year from then I became an associate and business development director for two years. 
In 2012 I was named CEO of the company, leading a 10 people team to more than 120 employees through a merger banking process never seen before in Spain during a financial downturn. iAhorro is now one of the leading Fintech companies in Spain with a team of more than 140 people, with a business figure that has grown by 200% in the last 3 years.

In February 2016 I begin my second challenging adventure in Education Industry as an entrepreneur in the digital world with great enthusiasm and will to create a positive impact around the world. I had the opportunity to blend my two main passions, Internet and Education founding Sofia Square Technologies. Unfortunately, we didn´t succeed but I understood one of the most important lessons in life: Pain + Reflection = Progress

In October 2018, I started in TheVentureCity. Our Dream is to find, and help to build Unicorns (actually Iwanacorns) around the Globe and that´s what we are doing!!!! 🚀 💪☘️"
